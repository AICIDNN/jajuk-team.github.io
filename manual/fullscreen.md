It is available from the icon on the upper right corner. This mode is intended primarily for installations where Jajuk is used as media station.

Full screen looks something like this:

On the the top-right side of the screen, two buttons are available :

- <img src="/images/Exit_16x16.png" style="padding: 0px;margin: 0px"> : Exit from jajuk
- <img src="/images/Slim_window_16x16.png" style="padding: 0px;margin: 0px"> : Switch back to regular window mode (exit from the full screen mode)
