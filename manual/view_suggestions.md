# Suggestions view
This view provides assistance at selecting local albums (albums in your collection) and others information grabbed from the Internet like Last.FM services. The view is built of five tabs presented bellow:

![Image](/images/view_suggestions.png)

### Local albums information
- **Preferred**: shows the albums you play to most (shuffled so you don't get always the same albums). This view is refreshed every 10 tracks launches
- **Newest**: shows the albums you last added into your collection (shuffled as well). Refreshed every 10 tracks
- **Rarely listened**: shows some albums you don't play often, to propose you to listen them or to identify them for deleting. Refreshed every 10 tracks

#### Notes:
- Contextual menu (right click on an album thumb) allows to access to standard features like getting properties, CDDB retagging, get online covers...
- A left click on an already selected album launches it

### Last.FM information
- **Others albums**: shows all albums known for the current artist. The albums you own and who are accessible from your collection are marked in bold with an album icon. This view is refreshed when the artist changes
- **Similar artists**: displays similar artists as get from Last.FM (based on a social network). Artists already known in the collection are marked in bold. This view is refreshed when the artist changes

#### Notes:
- In _Others Albums_ tab, the contextual menu allows to open the Last.FM on the album directly if known and to access to standard album features if the album is already in the collection
- In "Similar artists" tab, the contextual menu allows to open the Last.FM on the selected artist
- A left click on an already selected album directly open the Last.FM page
- AudioScrobbing (the fact to send information on the title you listen to Last.FM to feed your profile) is managed in the [view preferences](view_preferences.html), Last.FM tab
