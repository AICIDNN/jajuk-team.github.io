# Lyrics view
The **lyrics view** display the lyrics of the current songs played.

Three buttons are available :

- The ``edit`` button makes the lyrics text editable
- The ``save`` button stores the changed lyrics either to the file tag if the file is editable (not write-protected) and if its format supports lyrics tag (for example, it is not the case of WAV files). If the audio file is not editable, the lyrics are stored into a txt file in the same directory. This file is encoded in unicode and is read by Jajuk when searching for lyrics. However, it's not a standard, others programs will probably don't find it.
- The ``delete``_ button deletes any lyrics support found : txt file or lyrics tags. All of them are removed if lyrics are found in both supports.
