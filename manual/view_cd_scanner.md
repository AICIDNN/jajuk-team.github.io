# CD Scanner view
This view allows building jajuk devices for CDs with audio files in seconds. 

<div class='info'>
It is used to create a Jajuk device based on a DATA CD, we mean a CD with audio files, not Audio CDs! 
(jajuk doesn't support audio CD encoding to audio files, check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_ripper">specialized programs</a>))
</div>

If you are not familiar with the Jajuk Device notion, please read [using devices](devices.html) page. 
You can create a CD device using the device view, but if you want to create a 50 MP3 CD Jajuk collection, 
it is much faster to use the CD Scanner that scans the CD and builds the device by simply providing:

- The CD name: ``ROCK 1`` for instance
- The CD location like (is saved for next scan): ``F:`` under Windows, ``/mnt/cdrom`` under Gnu/Linux

Then launch the scan by clicking on the ``Scan`` button.
