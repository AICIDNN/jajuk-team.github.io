- ![Image](/images/Ok_16x16.png): **user selection** to be played

- ![Image](/images/Clock_16x16.png). It is useful to know which are next tracks when there are no more than one or few files in the queue

- ![Image](/images/Repeat_16x16.png): **Repeated tracks** show tracks that are played in a loop.
