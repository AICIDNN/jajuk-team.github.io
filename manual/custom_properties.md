![Image](/images/Extra_tag_configurations.png)

By default, Jajuk only work with a small number of tags (artist, year...) but the music files may content many others. You can enable any tag into Jajuk using theÂ "Extra Tag Configurations" dialog.

If you want Jajuk to display extra tags, i.e. the composer of a mp3 file, you must add these extra tag to your Jajuk collection. You can do this easily with the new extra tag configurations. 

You can start the configurator by clicking on the menu "Properties" / "Extra Tag Configurations".

Extra tags can only be displayed. After you activated them, a deep refresh of your collection is performed. After that, you can enable the tag in every file table, where you want to display it.
