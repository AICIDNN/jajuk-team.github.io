# Files and tracks
In Jajuk a track is a "logical" tag view of an audio file. 

A track can map one to many identical audio files with same tags (same title, album, artist, genre, year, CDDB disk id, length and track number).

Jajuk selects the better quality file when several audio files different quality are available for the same track.

Jajuk is also capable to select files from mounted devices if the track maps several files where some are on a mounted devices and the others on unmounted ones.

Tracks are available from the Tracks perspective which provides a tag-based view of your collection. 

Files views are available from the Files perspective which provides a disk-based view of your collection.
