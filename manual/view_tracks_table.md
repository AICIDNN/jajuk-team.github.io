# Tracks table view
These view displays tracks from your collection in a table and is used to perform contextual operations and filtering. You can find more information on table in the section [using tables in views](using_tables_in_views.html). Note that a single track can actually map several files but will only be displayed once in this view.

### Notes
Like anywhere, you can hide files from unavailable devices using the ``show only mounted devices`` option from the **Configuration** top menu.

### Contextual menu
