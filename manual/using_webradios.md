# Using web radios

## Launching a webradio
To launch a webradio from the command bar, just click on the webradio button in the [main window](commands.html) and the currently selected station will be played (can take a while for some stations, because of the caching process). Webradios can also be launched from the [Webradio view](view_webradios.html).

## Selecting a webradio
- Click on the arrow at the right of the webradio button to display the webradio list popup. Note that the currently selected station is signalized by a green check
- Select a station in the popup
- Then, a click on the webradio button will launch the station you selected

## Adding or removing a webradio
Adding or removing radios are available from the [Webradio view](view_webradios.html).

## Tips to find and add web radio stations
The following explains how to extract the web radio URL from some radio web site or radio portal. 
A good example of a radio listing website is the _Reciva Radio Portal_ available at [https://www.reciva.com/](https://www.reciva.com/) 
(more than 10,000 radio stations up-to-date). To retrieve the radio URL of your choice:

- Use Firefox and go to [https://www.reciva.com/](https://www.reciva.com/)
- Start listening to the radio you want, this will open a small player window into Firefox
- In this Firefox player window, right click on: "Page Info" and choose the tab called "media"
- Select the radio URL media and do a right click, copy address to clipboard
- Then go in Jajuk and add the radio as described above

## Contributing to default Jajuk webradio directory
You can add webradios to the default Jajuk list (can be taken into account next release after our moderation). 
Just edit this [wiki page](http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/common-jukebox/Suggest_a_new_webradio_station).
