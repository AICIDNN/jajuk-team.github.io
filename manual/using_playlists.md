# Using Playlists

A playlist is a set of preselected tracks. Jajuk uses m3u format to read and write playlist files. 
Note that files in playlists can be located outside any Jajuk device. In this case, Jajuk can read them but some limitations apply to them. For instance, they are not added in the history bar.

You can manage playlist from the [Playlists view](view_playlist.html).

## Smart playlists
Jajuk automatically and dynamically builds some "smart" playlists :

- ![Image](/images/Playlist_new_40x40.png) **New Playlist**: void at startup, use it to create new playlists. Drag & drop inside from tree or table views to add tracks

- ![Image](/images/Playlist_bookmark_40x40.png) **Bookmarks playlist**: drag and drop track inside to quickly access your favorite tracks

- ![Image](/images/Playlist_bestof_40x40.png) **Best of playlist**: contains your collection favorite tracks

- ![Image](/images/Playlist_novelties_40x40.png) **Novelties**: last tracks added into the collection
