- The genre repartition (it is reliable only if your collection is well tagged). It allows you knowing which genre you own the most.
- The size repartition by devices. It allows you knowing what are your device sizes in comparison.
- Your entire collection size per month (one track can map several files). It is used to get a collection size evolution: can be useful to know if some cleanups are required for example.
- Your entire collection number of tracks per month. It shows how many actual different tracks you have, independently of the number of redundant files in your collection.
