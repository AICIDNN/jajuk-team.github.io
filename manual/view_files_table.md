# Files table view
This view shows all files from your collection in a table and is used to perform contextual operations and filtering. 
You can find more information on tables in general in the section [using tables in views](using_tables_in_views.html). 

<div class='info'>The view displays a file several times if it is located in several devices or directories</div>

## Notes

- Rate is related to the track, not to a single file.
- As usual, you can limit to files from mounted devices using the _show only mounted devices_ option in ``Configuration`` top menu.

## Contextual menu
