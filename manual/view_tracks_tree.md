# Tracks tree view
This view is located in the Tracks perspective. It allows you selecting or browsing your devices upon a logical (genre, artist, album, track) point of view. In this view, you will find:

- **Genres** (like Rock, POP, Classic, etc...).
- **Artists**
- **Albums**
- **Tracks** (note that a single track can map several identical files)

### Notes
- Neither Cover nor playlists are visible in this tree.
- Tree configuration (nodes expands, collapses) is saved for next Jajuk session.

You can select any item in the tree, all contextual menu actions will be applied recursively. For example, if you selected both _Acoustic_ and _Blues_ genres, then you right click and select **Play shuffle**, Jajuk will play randomly all your _Acoustic_ and _Blues_ tracks.

### Dragging and dropping items

At any time, you can drag one or more items (and drag them into the [Queue view](view_queue.html) or the [Playlists view](view_playlists.html) for instance).

Press CTRL or SHIFT to select several items. A drop into the [Queue view](view_queue.html) will play your selection immediately. 

**Play** or **Push** default behavior during a drag and drop can be set in the [view preferences/ Mode tab](view_preferences.html#modes-tab).

### Choosing sort type

The ``Sort by`` combobox at the top of the view allows to display tree by:

- Genres, Artists, Albums, Tracks (default)
- Artists, Albums, Tracks
- Albums, Tracks
- ...

### Contextual menu

Many actions (like **Play**, **Push**, **Create a report** or **Properties**) are available from the different items using contextual menu (right click). The features can depend on the nature of the item.
