# Using tables in views

## Editing table items

Some tables have two edition policies :

- **Read only** (default): double clicking on a row launches the track and it is not allowed to change values
- **Read/write**: double clicking on an editable value allows to change it. To launch a track, use the first column icon (play)

Use this button ![Image:edit.png](../images/Edit.png) located in the filtering panel to switch from one mode to the other.

### Synchronization with tree view

If the table view synchronization toggle button is set, a click in the Tree view filters accordingly files of this table view.

- The tables and trees graphical synchronization can be controlled independently on each table or tree view.
- The synchronized state of each view is saved between sessions.

### Filtering panel

To filter tracks/files following some criteria, select the criteria using the combo box (track name, artist and so on), then type the filter value in the text field and type [enter] (note that filtering occurs also automatically when typing stops). If filter value is void, all tracks/files will be displayed. _Any_criteria means that search is done on all available criteria. Word order is ignored.

- Filter type combo box : select the criteria you want to filter on.
- Filter value text field : type value you want to filter on.

### Selecting columns to show

To select columns you want to show, click on the column selector button:

Others features:

- Horizontal Scroll: resize columns a way that they are all fully displayed.
- Pack All Columns: optimizes columns size to remove blanks.

### Selection / drag and drop

- You can select all the rows using CTRL+A standard keystroke
- You can drag one or more rows (and drag them into the [Queue view](view_queue.html) or the [Playlists view](view_playlists.html) for instance). Press CTRL or SHIFT to select several rows.
