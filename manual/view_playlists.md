#  Playlist view
The Playlist view intends to create, change or read playlists.

### Different types of items
Jajuk manages two types of playlists :

- Regular playlists (.m3u files only for now)
- Smart build-in playlists (New, Best-of, Novelties, Bookmarks) automatically and dynamically created by Jajuk and that you can save or play. Further information about smart playlists is available on the [using playlists](using_playlists.html) page.
