# Ambiances

### What's an ambience ?
An ambience is simply a set of music genres. For example, "Techno" ambience can group Euro-Techno, 
House, Trance and Goa styles together. Jajuk comes with preselected ambiences out of the box but you can create new ones or add/remove 
styles from them.

### The Ambience Wizard

The ambience wizard is available from the Configuration, Manage Ambiences menu. It allows to create, remove or modify ambiences.

- Use the "Create" button to add a new ambience. Fill up ambience name and select associated genres using the Genres Selection Window. Note that it is very easy to clone an existing ambience: simply select source ambience from the existing ambiences combo box at the top of the window.
- Use the "Delete" button to remove an ambience.
- Change ambiences genres by clicking of genres buttons.

### How to use ambiences ?

Select an ambience using the drop-down button at the DJ button's right. 
Then, all generated playlists using the Global Shuffle, Novelties or Bestof functions (using the three buttons at the left 
or DJ button in Command view or in the tray) will be filtered using this ambience. Select the "Any" ambience to remove any filter.

### Tips
- Tag correctly your tracks with genre attribute if you want to make this feature fully useful. 
For example, you can use CDDB retag function to assist yourself. See [Editing tags and properties](editing_tags_and_properties.html).
- Don't use set Rating level to a value too high if your collection is young, otherwise, you will get very few tracks in you playlist.
- For proportion DJs: don't set proportion with ambiences mapping too few tracks or you will get very few tracks.
