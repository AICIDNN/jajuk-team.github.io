# The commands
The commands are located at the bottom or the top of Jajuk window. They are always visible in all perspectives and control the player and start smart functions.

### The search box
![Image:search_16x16.png](/images/Search_16x16.png) The search box can be used to find any file, track, genre, artist, album... for a given text. A result popup appears. Then launch the track by clicking on the list: the track will be played immediately.

### The history bar
![Image:history_16x16.png](/images/History_16x16.png) The history bar shows all tracks you played (can be cleared and configured in the [Preferences view](view_preferences.html)). Click on one track to launch it again. Note that tracks in the history bar may be on devices that are no more mounted. 
In this case, Jajuk will ask you to mount them if available.

### Modes

Modes set the player behavior when selected before and during the play. All combinations of modes are allowed. Note that you can see which tracks are repeated thanks special icons in the [view_playlist_editor.html playlist editor view].

- ![Image:repeat_16x16.png](/images/Repeat_16x16.png) **Repeat single mode** [default=off]): When checked, the next launched selection will be played in a loop. If it is checked during a play, only current track will repeat.

- ![Image:repeat_all_16x16.png](/images/Repeat_all_16x16.png) **Repeat all mode** [default=off]): When checked, the whole queue will be played in a loop. Planned tracks are not played.

- ![Image:shuffle_16x16.png](/images/Shuffle_16x16.png) **Shuffle mode** [default=off]: When checked, next launched selection will be played randomly. If it is checked during a play, current selection will randomize.

- ![Image:continue_16x16.png](/images/Continue_16x16.png) **Continue mode** [default=on]: When checked, player will not stop when selection is played but will continue to play next albums or tracks.

- ![Image:intro_16x16.png](/images/Intro_16x16.png)  **Intro mode** [default=off]: When checked, only a part of each track will be played (begin position and play time can bet set in the Parameter view/Options tab)

### <a name="smart"/>Smart functions

To avoid selecting tracks, you can use these high-level smart functions:

- ![Image:shuffle_global_32x32.png](/images/Shuffle_global_32x32.png) **Play shuffle** launch a shuffle track from the entire collection (only from mounted and ready devices). Using the drop down button, you can select track by track (default) or album by album mode

- ![Image:bestof_32x32.png](/images/Bestof_32x32.png) **Play best of** launch one of your favourite track (learned with dynamic rate) and with a bit of random

- ![Image:novelties_32x32.png](/images/Novelties_32x32.png) **Play novelties** launch one of newest tracks from your collection with a bit of random. Using the drop down button, you can select track by track (default) or album by album mode

- ![Image:Finish-32-32.png](/images/Finish-32-32.png) **Finish album**, useful when using shuffle mode and you find an album that you want to play completely

- ![Image:ddj-32-32.png](/images/Ddj-32-32.png) **Launch DJ selection** (See [Using digital djs](ddj.html))
