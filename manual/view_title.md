# The Title view
This view simply displays current played track name with some special text effects like fade. 

<div class='info'>Text is resized dynamically when you resize or reorganize the view.</div>

You can set the text to display using the Animation Pattern field in view preferences/Tab Patterns.

Animation stops on left click

Animations can be controlled using the new "Enable Title view animation effect" in Preferences view/ GUI tab (effect disabled by default, so enable it if you want to keep the effects running). This option affects also the full screen view.
